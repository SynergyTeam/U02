     Packager     Version: 020806.00

        Commandline is: "C:\mentorgraphics\7.9.5EE\SDD_HOME\wg\win32\bin\Package.exe -j"X:\MG\projects\L02-0101\L02-0101.prj" -CleanBuild -NoFill "

     The Common Database is at "X:\MG\projects\L02-0101\default\default.icdb".

     The Root of this design is "000_main".

     The Front End Snapshot of this design is "DCDV".

     The PCB Design Path of this design is at "X:\MG\projects\L02-0101\PCB\L02-0101.pcb".

     The Central Library is at "X:\MG\lib\PCB_Lib\SWITRON_CLIB\Central_Library.lmc".

     The SchematicDesignBackAnno status indicates that the
      Common DataBase is not available to receive updates.
     !THE iCDB WILL NOT BE UPDATED!

     Back annotation will not take place to the Common DataBase, however a
      BAM file will be created for reading purposes or processing through
      BAM Plus.

     The Disable Repackage status indicates that 
      Repackaging should be allowed.

     A new Target PDB will be created from the Central Library to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.

     Back annotation will not take place to the Common DataBase, however a
      BAM file will be created for reading purposes or processing through
      BAM Plus.  This -y option is useful in conjunction with the -i or -m
      options where the intent is only to test a new PDB against the 
      schematic symbols.
     !THE iCDB WILL NOT BE UPDATED!

     The cross mapping of symbol pin names to Part Number pin
      numbers will be checked for packaged symbols and mapped correctly
      for unpackaged symbols.

     Properties that have been checked off in the Property Definition Editor
      found at Library Manager/Common Properties will be checked for value
      differences between the PartsDB and the non-null properties on symbols.
     Those properties checked off (other than Part Number)
      will not be transferred from the PartsDB to symbols.
     The following properties were checked off in the Property Definition Editor:
       "Parametric"
       "Value2"
       "AmtTHPin"
       "AmtSMDPin"
       "PAGE_#"
       "DWG_NO"
       "UMD"
       "MFG"
       "IBIS"
       "Model Suffix"
       "Part Label"
       "VHDL Model"
       "Verilog Model"
       "Description"
       "Simulation Model"
       "Rating"
       "Tolerance"
       "Part Number"
       "Value"

     Checking for value differences between non-null symbol properties and PartsDB properties,
      but only for those properties checked off in the Property Definition Editor

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
     No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.

     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.

     Writing Integration\CDBBackAnno.bam for BAMPlus

     A BAM WasIs List: Integration\CDBBackAnno.bam has been created.
     There have been 1 pin number changes.
     The BAM file will list all of the from-to changes.

    REMEMBER, the Common DataBase is not in sync with the schematic
    until Packager is run again under conditions that permit the direct
    updating of the Common DataBase.

     Packager finished successfully.
